## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **1. Enhanced Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)**

```javascript
// 🛡️ COVERAGE THRESHOLDS - Pre-Push Guard Requirements
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 85,    // Global minimum
    branches: 80,      // Branch coverage
    functions: 85,     // Function coverage
    lines: 85          // Line coverage
  },
  // Agent-specific stricter thresholds
  'packages/core-agents/src/agents/*.ts': {
    statements: 90,    // AI agents require higher standards
    branches: 85,
    functions: 90,
    lines: 90
  },
  // API endpoints require high coverage
  'apps/api/src/routers/*.ts': {
    statements: 88,
    branches: 82,
    functions: 88,
    lines: 88
  }
}
```

### **2. Pre-Push Hook (`.husky/pre-push`)**

- **Zero-Bug Policy Header**: Visual branding and mission statement
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Calls enhanced pre-push guard script
- **Exit Strategy**: Blocks push on any validation failure

### **3. Pre-Push Guard Engine (`scripts/pre-push-guard.js`)**

#### **Multi-Phase Validation Pipeline:**

**🚀 Phase 1: Static Analysis (Always Required)**

- TypeScript compilation verification
- ESLint rule compliance
- Prettier formatting validation

**🧪 Phase 2: Testing & Coverage Enforcement**

- Unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- Coverage threshold validation (85%/80%/85%/85%)
- Agent-specific higher standards (90%/85%/90%/90%)

**🏗️ Phase 3: Build Validation (Critical branches)**

- Production build verification
- Bundle integrity checks

**🔒 Phase 4: Security & Quality (Production branches)**

- Security audit execution
- Bundle analysis (when available)

#### **Smart Branch Detection:**

```javascript
function shouldRunFullSuite(branchName, changedFiles) {
  // Full suite for critical branches
  if (['main', 'staging', 'develop', 'production'].includes(branchName)) {
    return true;
  }

  // Full suite if critical files changed
  const criticalFiles = [
    'package.json',
    'tsconfig.json',
    'jest.config.js',
    'playwright.config.ts',
    '.github/workflows',
    'apps/api',
    'packages/core-agents',
  ];

  return changedFiles.some(file =>
    criticalFiles.some(critical => file.includes(critical))
  );
}
```

### **4. Coverage Validator (`scripts/coverage-validator.js`)**

- **Standalone Coverage Analysis**: Independent coverage validation
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive coverage metrics and violations
- **Agent-Specific Validation**: Higher standards for AI agent code
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations for coverage
  improvement

## 📊 **Enhanced Package.json Scripts**

### **New Coverage-Focused Commands:**

```json
{
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='**/*.{ts,tsx}' --coverageReporters=text --coverageReporters=text-summary --coverageReporters=html --coverageReporters=json",
  "test:coverage:ci": "jest --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='**/*.{ts,tsx}' --coverageReporters=text-summary --coverageReporters=json --passWithNoTests",
  "test:coverage:detailed": "jest --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='**/*.{ts,tsx}' --coverageReporters=text --coverageReporters=html --verbose",
  "pre-push:guard": "node scripts/pre-push-guard.js",
  "pre-push:quick": "npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run test --passWithNoTests",
  "coverage:check": "jest --coverage --passWithNoTests --silent && node scripts/coverage-validator.js"
}
```
